# Facial Beauty Analysis using Distribution Prediction and CNN Ensembles

## Overview

Perform Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) using CNN ensembles originally trained for face verification (VGGFace2). Earth Mover Distance, Categorical Cross Entropy and Mean Squared Error are used to train models to predict the entire facial beauty distribution.
